When Websites are not loaded with the latest data, it could be because you have to delete cached files, in order to let the browser download new data. To empty the cache you can follow one of the instructions below:

* Open Microsoft Edge.
* Select Settings and more (the icon that looks like three dots).
* Select Settings.
* In the Settings sidebar, select Privacy and services.
* Under Clear browsing data, select Choose what to clear.
* In Clear browsing data, select the check box for each type of data, such as browsing history, cookies, and passwords, you want to clear from the cache.
* From the Time range list, select how far back Microsoft Edge should empty the cache
* Select Clear now.

## Why it is important to clear cache in edge ?

The cache consists of items that Microsoft Edge finds and saves while you surf the web. Websites can and do change their data regularly, so there's a chance that what's in your cache is outdated. When Microsoft Edge loads that outdated information, you won't see the most up-to-date information from the websites you visit.

Similarly, a cached version of a web page may include a form. If you’re trying to fill out a form but running into problems, consider clearing the cache and trying again.

In addition, when the server hardware on which a website runs is upgraded or its security configuration changes, you may not be able to sign in on a cached version of the site or access available features, such as viewing media or making purchases.

Finally—and more often than you'd expect—the cache inexplicably becomes corrupt. When this happens, all kinds of difficult-to-diagnose issues arise. If you're having trouble with Microsoft Edge and you can't pinpoint the problem, clearing the cache may help.
